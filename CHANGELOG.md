---

## [Unreleased]

- Add GGUF embedding inference through the shared resident session and opt-in LAN API:
  Ollama `/api/embed`, legacy `/api/embeddings`, and OpenAI `/v1/embeddings` with float
  or base64 vectors. BGE-M3 Q8_0 and Nomic v2 MoE Q8_0 passed the host 3584 MiB
  memory gate and are catalogued; Qwen3-Embedding-4B Q4_K_M measured 4411 MiB and is
  not catalogued. Xbox memory and throughput validation remains pending.
- Add catalogue-only Ollama `POST /api/pull` with NDJSON download progress, SHA-256
  verification, serialized pulls, and a load into the shared resident session on success.
- Keep embedding batches serial on the single-slot llama.cpp context; preserve model
  pooling metadata and return normalized vectors with optional dimensions. Fix truncation
  direction for LAST pooling (keep suffix not prefix), add EOS token append when GGUF
  requests it, reject invalid Matryoshka dimensions before inference, and filter embedding
  models from chat UI and POST /v1/chat/completions (400). Ollama library name aliases
  (`bge-m3`, `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe`, `qwen3-embedding:4b`) map to catalogue ids.

- **Research package and XAB baseline.** Added a citable Series S Dev Mode
  report with claim-level provenance, generated evidence tables/figures and a
  release runbook. Added `scripts/run-xab.sh` to compose text, KV, H9 and
  diffusion harnesses. Historical measurements without thermal/power sidecars
  remain explicitly non-production evidence.
- **Demo presentation edit.** Added a reproducible 30-fps hard-cut presentation
  edit for concise README walkthroughs. The raw Device Portal recording and
  its measured capture rate remain the only performance evidence.
- **Catalogue signing and reproducibility evidence.** Store CI now signs the
  bundled model catalogue with the GitHub Actions-held RSA key and the Store
  verifier imports the pinned CNG public-key blob explicitly. The Xbox Series S
  Dev capture in `bench/results/phase17-console-2026-08-26.csv` records three
  post-warm-up runs with model hash, context, TTFT, throughput and peak memory;
  external power and thermal-equilibrium evidence remain separate gates.
- **CI benchmark validation fix.** Closed the CSV-validation loop in
  `build-linux.yml` so the shell `for`/`if` block is syntactically complete and
  all v2 benchmark rows are validated in Linux CI.

## [1.5.6.0] - 2026-08-22

Phase 16 catalogue win plus the pin and probes that landed with it, plus the
SDK transition (SessionHub factory, probe optionals, RoutingPolicy configurability,
Doxygen docs). Product ship path remains **CI MSVC**. Suite is still **10**
console gates.

**Upgrading from 1.5.x is a normal in-place update** (same package identity
`GianlucaMazza.xllama`).

### SDK

- **Modular SDK documentation.** Replaced the monolithic 594-line `docs/SDK.md`
  with 11 focused `.md` files under `docs/sdk/` (`overview`, `session`,
  `inference`, `routing`, `training`, `chat`, `kvstore`, `path`, `platform`,
  `sampling`, `misc`) — 742 lines total, each covering a single public-header
  group.

- **SessionHub factory pattern.** `SessionHub` now has an explicit constructor
  (`SessionHub::ensure_locked` / `reset_locked`) while keeping the
  backward-compatible `session_hub()` singleton. Callers that need explicit
  lifecycle can construct directly; the rest keeps working unchanged.

- **Probe optionals.** `CMakeLists.txt` now gates all probe sources under
  `option(XLLAMA_BUILD_PROBES "Build benchmarking probes" ON)`. CLI `--membw`,
  `--diskbw`, `--ramceil`, `--gpubw`, `--gpugemv` and the headless `.flag`
  files are absent when built with `-DXLLAMA_BUILD_PROBES=OFF`.

- **RoutingPolicy configurability.** All five routing gates (`dml_text_model_ok`,
  `decide`, `allow_kind`, `reuse_kv_kind`, `reuse_kv_model`) are now
  `std::function` callbacks on `RoutingPolicy`, with member wrappers dispatching
  through them. `default_policy()` returns a fully-configurable instance. Free
  functions (`dml_text_model_ok()`, `decide_routing()`, etc.) wrap the
  lazy-static default for backward compat.

- **Doxygen comments.** All 34 public headers in `include/xllama/` now carry
  `///` Doxygen documentation on every struct, class, method, and field.
  `InferenceParams` / `InferenceResult` fields rewritten to fix duplicate
  `abort_flag` declaration and add `///` on every member.

### Added

- **H6.2 wave32 Q4_K GEMV density probe** (`gpugemv.flag`,
  `shaders/gpugemv_q4k_wave32.hlsl`). Measure-only, not a Session GPU backend.
  Series S CI MSVC `1.5.5.922`: G1 PASS, `wave32` median **25.4 GB/s packed**
  (retimed naive 1.96). **K2 park** — G2 stays 40. CSV
  `bench/results/phase15-gpugemv-h62.csv`.
- **Store D1 App vs Game spike** on Series S (`lfm25-350m`, same package).
  App GPU budget **691 vs 3801 MB**; long-gen decode ~87 vs ~95 tok/s; peak
  320 MB both. Listing should request **Game** metadata. CSV
  `bench/results/store-app-vs-game-2026-08-21.csv`.
- **`validate-console.sh store`** — Store SKU smoke (catalogue download + GGUF
  chat + `set_api` reject). Not one of the 10 Dev Mode hardware gates. **PASS**
  2026-08-21 on CI Store SKU `1.5.5.928` (Game); Dev SKU restored after.
- **Store Phase 2 pack:** EN listing copy, IARC prep sheet, Partner Center
  operator steps (`docs/store-readiness.md`); GitHub Pages privacy URL
  `https://gianlucamazza.github.io/xllama/privacy.html`; Settings link + Issues
  template to report inappropriate generated content (Store policy 11.16).
  Product **xllama** reserved in Partner Center as **Game** (`9N9661XSDBM4`;
  identity §13). An App reservation (`9NCNLPWFT6B5`) was deleted the same day.
  Dev Mode identity unchanged. Submission fill sheet (pricing, IARC GenAI,
  Creators, packages hold) in `docs/store-readiness.md` §14.
- **`include/xllama/json_utils.h`** — header-only JSON string helpers:
  `json_escape()` (canonical) and `json_read_string()` with full `\uXXXX`
  decode (including surrogate pairs → UTF-8). Replaces 7 duplicated
  implementations across the tree.
- **`src/bridge/decode_loop_ort.h`** — consolidated ORT GenAI decode loop.
  Mirrors the structure of `src/bridge/decode_loop.h` (llama path).
- **`src/bridge/ort_common.h`** — shared ORT setup helpers (SEH translator,
  log callback registration).
- **CI ASan lane** (`build-linux.yml` job `asan`): workflow_dispatch-only.
  Builds with the `linux-asan` CMake preset (Debug + ASan + UBSan) and runs
  the full test suite under sanitizers.
- **`tests/test_json_utils.cpp`** — 11 test cases covering json_escape
  (quotes, backslash, control chars → `\uXXXX`, mixed content),
  json_read_string (all escapes, `\uXXXX`, surrogate pairs, lone surrogates,
  unterminated strings, unknown escapes lenient), and round-trip
  (escape → read_string → original).
- **`include/xllama/cancel_policy.h`** — `CancelTarget` enum +
  `cancel_target()` precedence function (image > training > text). The generic
  "a job is running" flag is set by all three, so the specific flags are the
  only ones that identify the job. Exhaustively tested on the host
  (`tests/test_cancel_policy.cpp`, all eight combinations of the three flags).
- **Autopilot op `mark`** — a rendez-vous for screenshot capture. The app writes
  a label to `LocalState\autopilot-mark.txt` and blocks; the host polls for the
  file, takes its Device Portal screenshot, and deletes the file to release the
  script.
- **Autopilot op `show_pane`, and a guard against the crash designing it
  exposed.** Settings, History and the image viewer are all `ContentDialog`s and
  none was reachable from the autopilot. The guard is product code: nothing
  checked whether a dialog was already open, and a second one throws inside a
  `fire_and_forget`, whose `unhandled_exception()` calls `std::terminate()`.
  `AutopilotAction` gained a dedicated `label` field. Ops 15 → 17.

### Fixed

- **json_escape triplicated across 7 TUs with divergent behavior.** Consolidated
  into `include/xllama/json_utils.h` (single canonical implementation, full
  `\uXXXX` control-char escaping). All callers now use `xllama::json_escape`.
  The training job parser (`src/bridge/training.cpp`) was also upgraded to
  decode `\uXXXX` (including surrogate pairs → UTF-8) via the new
  `json_read_string` helper — previously `\u0041` was passed through verbatim
  as `u0041`, a correctness gap for non-ASCII dataset paths/names.
  `device_train.cpp`'s `result.json` writer (which passed control chars raw,
  producing invalid JSON) is now fixed. Full round-trip tested
  (`tests/test_json_utils.cpp`, 11 cases).

- **ORT stateless path silently ignored stop_sequences.**
  `run_inference_ort` (inference.cpp) never checked `params.stop_sequences`,
  while `OrtSession::run_decode` did. Both paths now share the consolidated
  `decode_loop_ort.h` loop which applies stop sequences after each iteration
  (same semantics as llama.cpp: the stop-triggering token IS counted).

- **ORT decode loop duplicated** between `run_inference_ort` (inference.cpp)
  and `OrtSession::run_decode` (session.cpp) — the exact pattern the project
  had already fixed on the llama side. Extracted into
  `src/bridge/decode_loop_ort.h` (header-only, same structure as
  `decode_loop.h` for llama).

- **SEH translator and OgaSetLogCallback duplicated** between inference.cpp
  and session.cpp. Extracted into `src/bridge/ort_common.h`
  (`install_se_translator()`, `register_oga_logging()`).

- **The B button no longer drops out of the app.** On Xbox an unhandled
  `BackRequested` is the shell's cue to suspend and return to Home, and the
  handler only marked the event handled while an inference was running — so a
  B press on an idle chat closed xllama with no warning. Completed turns are
  already on disk, so this cost the typed-but-unsent prompt, the KV cache and a
  full model reload, not the conversation. Every `BackRequested` is now
  handled: B cancels a running reply and otherwise does nothing; leaving the
  app stays on the Xbox (Guide) button (`uwp/MainPage.cpp`,
  `docs/uwp-constraints.md` §10e, `docs/using-the-app.md`).

## [1.5.5.0] - 2026-08-20

Phase 16 catalogue win plus the pin and probes that landed with it. Product
ship path remains **CI MSVC**. Suite is still **10** console gates.

**Upgrading from 1.5.x is a normal in-place update** (same package identity
`GianlucaMazza.xllama`).

### Added

- **Phase 16 model-scouting campaign** (`docs/phase16-model-scouting.md`) and
  its first shipped result: catalogue entry **`lfm25-230m`** (LFM2.5-230M
  Q4_K_M, direct from LiquidAI so the LFM Open License travels with the
  weights). Console-measured on Series S at **119.2 tok/s decode / 241 MB peak
  / H9 2/8** — it becomes the **floor** tier, displacing `gemma3-270m` at
  1.55× its decode and 127 MB less peak, at one H9 task below it. The
  first-launch default stays `lfm25-350m`, which is slower and heavier but
  scores 4/8: the default trades throughput for capability deliberately.
  Evidence `bench/results/phase16-gguf.csv`, `bench/results/phase7-h9.jsonl`.
- **`gemma3-270m` H9 measured for the first time (3/8).** Its `model-matrix`
  §A1 cell had carried `—` since the model was catalogued, which is what made
  the floor-tier comparison uncomputable until now.
- **MiniCPM5 chat renderer** (`model_is_minicpm5`: template `<s>` BOS +
  no-think prefill). Host T1 passes both halves; T3 console bench was not
  booked this campaign, so `minicpm5-1b` is **not** in the catalogue.
- **`diskbw` NVMe probe** (`diskbw.flag` / `scripts/bench-diskbw.sh`). Series S
  unbuffered read ~2.0 GB/s sequential / 1.55–1.76 GB/s random 2 MiB. SSD
  streaming is real, narrow, and not a product path
  (`docs/ssd-inference-assessment.md`).
- **WS-F microphone probe** (`mic.flag` / `scripts/probe-mic.sh`).
  `AudioGraph` opens under AppContainer; `AccessDenied` did not fire; no
  headset was attached (`DeviceNotAvailable`). Not a verdict — #241 stays
  open. `docs/uwp-constraints.md` §10d.
- **Markdown formatting is gated in CI**, pinned to `prettier@3.9.6` alongside
  the existing `clang-format==22.1.5`, over every tracked `*.md`
  (`.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`). The repo had no Markdown formatter and
  had drifted; the whole corpus was formatted once in the same change.

### Changed

- **`llama.cpp` pin `6d5a910` → `0865990` (b10333, #244)** with UWP glue
  (`llama-kv-cache-msa.cpp`, `llama_model_params.load_mode`, sampler
  `n_vocab` on penalties). Phase 16 WS-B had closed without a bump — both
  desk `arch:not-in-pin` flags were refuted at the GGUF header — and this
  Dependabot bump is independent of that kill.
- **H5 BitNet/low-bit survey closed NO-GO** (2026-08-10). The pin carries the
  `bitnet` arch; no sub-4B model trained at ≤2 bits publishes weights.
- **Phase 16 WS-E (embeddings) closed** — S-gate FAIL, no named consumer.
  Capability exists in the pin (`nomic-bert`); the product has no surface.
  Tracked as #242.

### Fixed

- **Documentation drift found by the Phase 16 audit**: `model-matrix` §D
  claimed `H2 open` while §A3 of the same file recorded H2 FAIL; its "Last
  updated" stamp predated its own newest content; §G still listed a shipped
  MSIX as an open gap; `benchmarks.md` cited a stale `llama.cpp` pin;
  `recommended-config.md` enumerated a four-gate console suite that has been
  ten gates since v1.5.4.0; and the Phase 16 campaign doc had wrongly listed
  H5 (BitNet) as closed when it is an open desk survey.
- **`deploy.sh` stop/start** actually stop and start; an unreachable console
  and a missing CSRF token now fail instead of claiming success.
- **Wine 11.15**: `ensure-cppwinrt-pin.sh` prefers the native cppwinrt at the
  pin. `quantize.sh` pointed at a tree we never build.
- **CI**: `check-coherence.py` asks git which Markdown we own; shellcheck is
  pinned; the clang-cl ggml patch is versioned instead of carried untracked.
